            Adaptive immunity in bacteria is accomplished by the CRISPR system, and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas).
            Proteins coupled with RNA are guided by this system to recognize and cleave foreign genetic material. As
            such,
            itâ€™s also a powerful method for genome editing, and is receiving lot of bio technical and medical attention
            currently. By using single molecule FRET we can study this system in great detail, and obtain a wealth of
            structural and kinetic information, when combining with other techniques. Read how we did this in Stella et
            al.
            (2018), published in Cell.
