const whatWeDoText = `The main objective of my group is to augment our understanding
    on the molecular mechanisms that underlie and control vital cellular functions.
    We approach this challenge by deciphering the dynamic interplay between the function and spatiotemporal
    localization of biomolecules (virus, dug nanocarrier, oligonucleotides or protein assemblies) and how this 
    correlate to cellular and organismal response.
    
    <br><br>
    
    We have therefore pioneered the development of novel new imaging technologies - 
    with an emphasis on single particle and live cell microscopy - that promises to shed 
    light on the interplays between the behavior (dynamics, function and localization) of 
    biomolecules and high throughput single particle screening methodologies to decipher oligonucleotide
    interactions with membranes. By tracking the spatiotemporal displacement
    and localization of one protein - or an assembly - in real time we revealed internalization pathways
    and cell fate of nanoparticles and viruses. Our functional and FRET studies at the fundamental limit 
    of individual catalytic cycle, on the other hand have helped deciphering protein structure and function
    dependence on temporal cell localization and the design of novel ligand biasing aberrant biological function.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Recognizing that 4D imaging generates terabytes of data sets,
    that are prohibitively hard to be quantitatively evaluated by 
    current semi-manual analysis, we have developed toolboxes and softwares
    based on machine learning to rapidly, reliably and free of human cognitive biases, 
    analyze the wealth of novel microscopy data we, and others, produce. Our all-inclusive softwares
    for windows and macs, offer transition from raw data to quantitative analysis and data classification 
    with less than 5 clicks, accelerating the automatic analysis by ~6 orders of magnitude. These combined 
    methodologies bridge 4D imaging with sophisticate image analysis required for delving into the era of 4D
    cell and tissue imaging.`;
